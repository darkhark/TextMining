This repo will cover assignemnts from UCF 6307

# Assignment 01 Directions
To run the code for assignment 01, this repo will be required. Once cloned,
all that you need to do is run the script "assignment01Generator.py". 

The script writes to a file in the docs directory names Assignment01 for the first
half of the assignment. It then opens a GUI for the spellchaecker portion of the assignment.
The GUI makes use of some threading, but please do not hammer down on "Check" button too many times.
I could write it so the button is disabled until the thread is complete, but I've already spent too much 
time on the assignment.

For the spell checker, only up to 15 words will be added to the Tkinter Text.
